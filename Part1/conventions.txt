variables - lowercase first letter, capitalize at space ie. pathFound
method/class names - uppercase first letter and at space ie. PathFinding
include comments at function groups, class variables, inline for methods


Search algorithms, distance functions -> SearchAlgorithms class
main method and diagnostics           -> FindPlan class
State definition and innerworkings    -> State class 


Problems
try implementing heap - heap implemented but since state map is generated at runtime states arent all uniquely classified

try pre generated map:
i) generate all states and allowed transitions
ii) traverse map using search algorithms with heap

much faster at runtime but larger unique state generation, plus assuming pre run map generated.
